We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party since some guests will need to sleep on the sofa bed and the floor mattress. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology.   \u2022 The building does not have an elevator and guests will need to climb one set of stairs.   \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :)   \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside. Please help us keep them out by keeping windows & doors closed.   \u2022 We use Airbnb's Multi-Listing feature, which allows hosts to list multiple units provided that they are similar in appearance and have no major aesthetic differences. This means that there may be slight variances to unit layout given the historic age of the building (please see listing photos for variations). Please be assured that the square footage, decor, amenities and sleeping accommodations will be the same. \u2022  Vacation Rental License No.: BTR006192

We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology. \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :) \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside. Please help us keep them out by keeping windows & doors closed. \u2022 We use Airbnb's Multi-Listing feature, which allows hosts to list multiple units provided that they are similar in appearance and have no major aesthetic differences. This means that there may be slight variances to unit layout given the historic age of the building (please see listing photos for variations).

We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party since some guests will need to sleep on the sofa bed and floor mattresses. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology. Additionally, we are located on Harding Avenue, which is a busier street, so some street noise may be heard.   \u2022 The building does not have an elevator and guests will need to climb one set of stairs.   \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :)   \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside.

We want to ensure they have the best experience during their stay. We understand the concerns with the latest updates on the Corona Virus and wanted to be proactive with some details and reassurances about our property and services.  First some positive benefits \u2026 We are a small property vs a large hotel with tons of un-monitored traffic.  Our Cottage is a separate building next to our house and we have good communication with all our guests prior to their arrival.  We like to treat them like family when they stay with us. The Cottage was recently remodeled so all appliances and furnishings are up to date. I do all the cleaning myself and always take extra care using disinfectant cleaners and wipes to clean. We will be taking extra care on all touched surfaces with the new updates as well. We also have a new special air purifying device that uses ultraviolet light rated to kill germs and virus in the air. And of course we supply soap for hand washing during your visit. In addition you can check our on line reviews and see we have always maintained a continuous five star rating for sparkling clean. I hope that gives you additional information to answer any concerns you may have. Florida is wonderful this time of year. Beaches are open and we have lots of sunshine and fresh air and outdoor spaces to take advantage of while you are here and just relaxing out back by the lake under the Tiki Hut is also a great experience. We do suggest you check your flights and travel schedules as we are aware that some schedule changes are taking place.

We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party since some guests will need to sleep on the sofa bed and floor mattresses. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology.   \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :)   \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside. Please help us keep them out by keeping windows & doors closed.   \u2022 There is no parking on premise, but free street parking is available in the neighborhood.   \u2022 We use Airbnb's Multi-Listing feature, which allows hosts to list multiple units provided that they are similar in appearance and have no major aesthetic differences. This means that there may be slight variances to unit layout given the historic age of the building (please see listing photos for variations).

We're also 2 miles from the convention center and Lincoln Road Mall. Air conditioner: Please, keep it *ON* all the time, with  temperature at or below 78 F. Keep the windows and door tightly closed, as keeping them opened would cause condensation in the apartment (that eventually leads to mold!) and the temperature in the apartment won\u2019t go down. This is a self check in property. You certify that you are willing and able to follow all instructions being provided on AirBnb through the house manual, the check in guide and chat messages. You also agree that you are not going to contact your AirBnb host before reading all instructions.

Use these spaces at your own risk.

Please, use common sense while enjoying this place. Florida warm weather allows animal life to thrive. Leaving the doors or windows opened for any extend of time may let in flies or other bugs. Thanks for understanding. If you are going to need any kid\u2019s or baby\u2019s amenities we offer, please, let us know in advance so we can relocate the amenities you\u2019ll need to your apartment, as they are very low demand equipment. To ensure you get settled in and have a great start to your stay with us, we have provided an initial supply of toilet paper (along with a few extra rolls under the bathroom sink) and of other things, but these may not be enough for your entire stay, and you may need to purchase additional supplies.

We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party since some guests will need to sleep on the sofa bed and the floor mattresses. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology.   \u2022 The building does not have an elevator and guests will need to climb one set of stairs.   \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :)   \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside. Please help us keep them out by keeping windows & doors closed.   \u2022 We use Airbnb's Multi-Listing feature, which allows hosts to list multiple units provided that they are similar in appearance and have no major aesthetic differences. This means that there may be slight variances to unit layout given the historic age of the building (please see listing photos for variations).

It is ideal for 2 adult guests but can accommodate up to 5 guests.  We recommend full capacity only for short stays, as it will feel very much like a slumber party since some guests will need to sleep on the sofa beds. \u2022 This is a historic building and while newly refurbished, the walls are on the thinner side. As such, we ask guests to be mindful of noise levels. Loud music is not permitted at any time and quiet hours are enforced. There are security cameras on the exterior spaces of the building and the property may use Noise Aware technology.   \u2022 The building does not have an elevator and guests will need to climb one set of stairs.   \u2022 As with any regular Airbnb stay, daily housekeeping is not included but we\u2019re happy to drop off towels & toiletries as needed :)   \u2022 Tropical pests are endemic to our area. We have regular preventative pest control, but it's possible that a critter might sneak inside.

An online \"terms & conditions\" form separate from Airbnb must be signed before check-in in which you have to send a copy of your ID. This is our virtual registration form. Please kindly note that this is a multi-unit listing. What is being rented is a room type but not a specific unit #. We have multiple units that are identical in layout and have the same furniture and amenities. However, there may be very slight detail differences such as the coffee table, color of the couch, and linen. All units have been uniquely and beautifully designed. Unfortunately, we are not a pet-friendly property. We love our furry friends but unlucky situations have caused us to change our policy and strictly enforce it. Service Animal Assurance Form must be completed for reservation accompanied by a Service Animal. IMPORTANT: A person who knowingly and willfully misrepresents herself or himself as using a service animal and\/or being qualified to use a service animal commits a misdemeanor of the second degree. Animals whose sole purpose function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Quiet hours from 11 PM to 7 AM (No Loud noise or music) We service our units in the Airbnb\/Apartment-Style Model. We do not offer regular hotel amenities and do not offer traditional housekeeping services. We set up our units with all the essentials for our guests to start their stay. As products are needed our guests replenish from local markets. On-site washers\/dryers are offered in order to maintain personal and accommodation linen. Extra cleaning services are available at a surcharge. Because of South Florida's tropical climate, we perform monthly fumigation services every once a  month with a  professional company. We will kindly need access to all units in order to perform this service. Prior notice will be sent when this service will be performed. The treatment is odorless and non-toxic to humans. NOTE: Windows may be sealed\/blocked and as a precautionary measure we recommend maintaining them closed if not screened, along with keeping doors closed to decrease the chances of outsider insects from accessing units. Due to our area's humidity, we highly encouraged you to maintain all windows\/doors closed with the airconditioner set to auto no higher than 75 degrees to avoid moisture. No Smoking on premises (smoking on site will be subject to a $250 penalty and automatic removal from our apartment) The host reserves the right to enter the unit for emergencies and service orders with previous notice to the guests. Please note that this is a building with 7 floors that normally has a working elevator. At the moment we are in the transition of upgrading our elevator, until then our elevator operates inconsistently. Please consider the possibility of having to climb up to 6 flights for some, most, or even during your entire stay with us. Prices are currently discounted with this in mind.","the_neighborhood":"","place_offers":{"Bathroom":["Hair dryer","3 in 1 shampoo","3 in 1 conditioner","Hot water","Shower gel"],"Bedroom and laundry":["Paid washer \u2013 In building","Paid dryer \u2013 In building","Essentials","Hangers","Bed linens","Iron"],"Entertainment":["32\" HDTV with Roku"],"Heating and cooling":["Window AC unit"],"Home safety":["Security cameras on property","Smoke alarm","Fire extinguisher"],"Internet and office":["Wifi"],"Kitchen and dining":["Kitchen","Refrigerator","Microwave","Dishes and silverware","Freezer","Electric stove","Coffee maker: drip coffee maker","Toaster","Dining table"],"Outdoor":["Shared BBQ grill: charcoal"],"Parking and facilities":["Free parking garage on premises \u2013 1 space"],"Services":["Long term stays allowed","Self check-in","Smart lock"],"Not included":["Carbon monoxide alarm","Private entrance","Heating"]},"sub_rating":{"Cleanliness":"4.2","Accuracy":"4.3","Communication":"4.6","Location":"4.6","Check-in":"4.4","Value":"4.1"},"overallrating":"","overallcount":"","house_rules":{"Checking in and out":["Check-in: 4:00 PM - 2:00 AM","Checkout before 11:00 AM","Self check-in with smart lock"],"During your stay":["2 guests maximum","No pets","No parties or events","No smoking","Additional rules"]},"safety_property":{"Safety devices":["Security camera\/recording device","Carbon monoxide detector not required","Smoke alarm installed"],"Property info":["Some spaces are shared","Potential for noise"]},"rooms_details":{"Bedroom area":"1 queen bed"}},{"image_uls":["https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/7f8bea48-de0d-4429-9c9f-82cf9b7253c6.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/958a5711-7d7c-4fdb-95a4-3e5ba95534cf.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/26780b7f-2041-4b0a-8369-38cb48f854a8.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/caa87fdd-5cea-4de4-a237-09e0b0697c6a.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/a8138523-9ea2-46f5-b518-9421cc3ce3b9.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/209c4834-d2d0-4702-a9b7-2c0df87062b8.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/ed09f16d-6c85-4576-87ef-13bdd10afe8f.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/48c939cb-e0be-4038-a2fe-38ec68d08763.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/c1d1a0c8-78d0-4e54-9e96-51a31544e886.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/b3ddedcc-ced0-41a6-bb27-3997d533704e.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/b055687b-1e2d-4ec2-bbb9-3f5f4ba25219.jpg"],"summary":"Indulge in the regal comfort of our exquisite king-size bed, fit for royalty.

Please help us keep them out by keeping windows & doors closed.   \u2022 We use Airbnb's Multi-Listing feature, which allows hosts to list multiple units provided that they are similar in appearance and have no major aesthetic differences. This means that there may be slight variances to unit layout and views given the historic age of the building (please see listing photos for variations).

Please kindly note that this is a multi-unit listing. What is being rented is a room type but not a specific unit #. We have multiple units that are identical in layout and have the same furniture and amenities. However, there may be very slight detail differences such as the coffee table, color of the couch, and linen. All units have been uniquely and beautifully designed. Unfortunately, we are not a pet-friendly property. We love our furry friends but unlucky situations have caused us to change our policy and strictly enforce it. Service Animal Assurance Form must be completed for reservation accompanied by a Service Animal. IMPORTANT: A person who knowingly and willfully misrepresents herself or himself as using a service animal and\/or being qualified to use a service animal commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.

As products are needed our guests replenish from local markets. On-site washers\/dryers are offered in order to maintain personal and accommodation linen. Extra cleaning services are available at a surcharge. Because of South Florida's tropical climate, we perform monthly fumigation services every once a  month with a  professional company. We will kindly need access to all units in order to perform this service. Prior notice will be sent when this service will be performed. The treatment is odorless and non-toxic to humans. NOTE: Windows may be sealed\/blocked and as a precautionary measure we recommend maintaining them closed if not screened, along with keeping doors closed to decrease the chances of outsider insects from accessing units. Due to our area's humidity, we highly encouraged you to maintain all windows\/doors closed with the airconditioner set to auto no higher than 75 degrees to avoid moisture.

a stylish experience at this centrally-located place! This 670sqft  apartment features an open-concept fully supplied kitchen, two separate designated work spaces; & partial view of the sea. \nEvery detail was thought to make your stay comfortable and feeling at your own apartment. Enjoy 2 tvs, beautiful and funny glassware, silverware, and china elegantly  put together. 2 adults sleep on the kings size bed, one kid on the day bed, and there's an air mattress. Free parking!\n","the_space":"The space The apartment has beautiful light and a very relaxing view. There's no construction immediately next to our building, so the feeling of amplitude is very real. The balcony has a lateral view of the Coconut Grove marina. The balcony usually has a soft breeze, an ideal setting for breakfast or for a glass of wine in the afternoon. There were no details missed in this remodeling, as we plan to use it ourselves when we are in town.  Our ideal guests are couples who enjoy the life in Coconut Grove and nearby downtown\/Brickell area. A small child would sleep comfortably in the day bed in the living room, and a fourth person could sleep on an air mattress that we provide. The bedroom has a king size bed, with a dedicated work space. The master bedroom's window goes from floor to ceiling, so you'll have a view even lying in bed. We put up two nice sized TVs,  so that both, the living room and the bedroom can actually be used for work or entertainment. The dining table is set for 3 seats by default. If our guests need the 4th place, they can let me know in advance so I can set it up in advance, or they can simply slide the table away from the wall, and pull up its folding part. We leave it with one side folded down, so that circulation space is more comfortable, but there's enough space to sit 4 or 5 for dinner.  The kitchen is very well equipped with good quality cookware, knives, cutting boards, and utensils. Please note we don't provide a standard oven, but an over the counter big oven\/toaster (see pictures). ","gest_access":"Guest access The unit is located in a hotel, so you'll have access to many of the comforts of hotels. There's valet parking available, and you can also park you own car for free in our covered garage. The hotel has a pool, a gym, and a small bar\/restaurant in the lobby, managed by its owners. It's visited by many of the building residents, which gives it a very local flavor. There\u2019s a $50 convenience fee for check-in after 10pm, regardless if it was planned, or due to flight delays. Please check your flights before booking, so you know what to expect. ","other_things_to_note":"Other things to note Who shouldn't book this apartment: We have put a lot of love, time, and dedication in creating such a beautiful space, therefore... If you're looking for a party place, this apartment is not your best option. College-aged get togethers involving alcohol generally bring spillages, burns, stains, breaks, tears in fabric, and  especially, lots of head aches when you realize the damages. Some owners will overlook them, please know that I won't! If you smoke, please refrain from booking this apartment. The smell of cigars, cigarettes, and marijuana, even if smoked outside with the balcony door closed, my experience is that the smell inevitably gets to the cushions and fabrics inside. If I need to send anything to the dry cleaners, unfortunately, I'll have to transfer that cost to you, plus an administrative fee of $25.","the_neighborhood":"","place_offers":{"Scenic views":["Bay view","Marina view","Sea view"],"Bathroom":["Hair dryer","Cleaning products","Shampoo","Conditioner","Body soap","Hot water"],"Bedroom and laundry":["Washer","Free dryer \u2013 In unit","Essentials","Hangers","Bed linens","Room-darkening shades","Iron"],"Entertainment":["HDTV with standard cable","Exercise equipment"],"Heating and cooling":["Central air conditioning"],"Home safety":["Smoke alarm","Carbon monoxide alarm"],"Internet and office":["Wifi","Dedicated workspace"],"Kitchen and dining":["Kitchen","Refrigerator","Microwave","Cooking basics","Dishes and silverware","Freezer","Dishwasher","Stainless steel electric stove","Oven","Hot water kettle","Coffee maker","Wine glasses","Toaster","Baking sheet","Blender","Dining table"],"Outdoor":["Private patio or balcony","Outdoor furniture","Outdoor dining area"],"Parking and facilities":["Free parking on premises","Shared outdoor pool - available all year, open specific hours"],"Services":["Host greets you"],"Not included":["Security cameras on property","Heating"]},"sub_rating":{"Cleanliness":"5.0","Accuracy":"4.8","Communication":"4.9","Location":"4.9","Check-in":"4.8","Value":"4.8"},"overallrating":"","overallcount":"","house_rules":{"Checking in and out":["Check-in: 4:00 PM - 10:00 PM","Checkout before 11:00 AM"],"During your stay":["3 guests maximum","No pets","No parties or events","No smoking"],"Before you leave":["Gather used towels","Throw trash away","Return keys","Additional requests"]},"safety_property":{"Safety devices":["Carbon monoxide alarm installed","Smoke alarm installed"]},"rooms_details":{"Living room":"1 air mattress","Bedroom":"1 king bed"}},{"image_uls":["https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/d224c899-0e69-406d-b4cb-d263a3f93206.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/575d59b6-70c7-43d7-ae21-554a30134309.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/dd201f69-311e-4e64-81d5-25e4109c70ef.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/963ec91c-fb8a-4368-bf66-c4d3d13a5c94.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/63af17f4-ab18-4216-aaac-60e67f222f37.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/8b5c6edf-47e1-40ea-acda-0756c1c4cfab.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/18db91f6-da08-45c5-8141-57a3787beeed.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/ed1b4f31-1351-4ef3-973a-760192ddbc99.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/58b97f3f-2ee6-443a-a997-62805c77b5d9.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/c7daa0a8-26b0-4e2c-9f6d-7f556a313328.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/44ea5ce6-fbf2-464b-8ab6-53cd58f1996f.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/f7c67808-2150-4cfa-a0f8-d220224e9323.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/f082d633-2ae6-425d-a116-d946e045cfd9.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/91135fa5-9607-45e7-b137-aae4a0c86ec0.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/14e8b5ed-7c74-4ead-9e76-864b242834bf.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/1045b65a-de55-4541-8836-ad5f26c7b995.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/916cdd2e-aef7-44cc-ac3a-5a8c2fcd3163.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/5909f5bd-377c-4ac0-b6d6-b0b1529f2439.jpg"],"summary":"A modern style and freshly renovated large beachfront studio apartment in Miami Beach with 180 degree ocean views of the crystal clear water and free parking.

a stylish experience at this centrally-located place! This 670sqft  apartment features an open-concept fully supplied kitchen, two separate designated work spaces; & partial view of the sea. \nEvery detail was thought to make your stay comfortable and feeling at your own apartment. Enjoy 2 tvs, beautiful and funny glassware, silverware, and china elegantly  put together. 2 adults sleep on the kings size bed, one kid on the day bed, and there's an air mattress. Free parking!\n","the_space":"The space The apartment has beautiful light and a very relaxing view. There's no construction immediately next to our building, so the feeling of amplitude is very real. The balcony has a lateral view of the Coconut Grove marina. The balcony usually has a soft breeze, an ideal setting for breakfast or for a glass of wine in the afternoon. There were no details missed in this remodeling, as we plan to use it ourselves when we are in town.  Our ideal guests are couples who enjoy the life in Coconut Grove and nearby downtown\/Brickell area. A small child would sleep comfortably in the day bed in the living room, and a fourth person could sleep on an air mattress that we provide. The bedroom has a king size bed, with a dedicated work space. The master bedroom's window goes from floor to ceiling, so you'll have a view even lying in bed. We put up two nice sized TVs,  so that both, the living room and the bedroom can actually be used for work or entertainment. The dining table is set for 3 seats by default. If our guests need the 4th place, they can let me know in advance so I can set it up in advance, or they can simply slide the table away from the wall, and pull up its folding part. We leave it with one side folded down, so that circulation space is more comfortable, but there's enough space to sit 4 or 5 for dinner.  The kitchen is very well equipped with good quality cookware, knives, cutting boards, and utensils. Please note we don't provide a standard oven, but an over the counter big oven\/toaster (see pictures). ","gest_access":"Guest access The unit is located in a hotel, so you'll have access to many of the comforts of hotels. There's valet parking available, and you can also park you own car for free in our covered garage. The hotel has a pool, a gym, and a small bar\/restaurant in the lobby, managed by its owners. It's visited by many of the building residents, which gives it a very local flavor. There\u2019s a $50 convenience fee for check-in after 10pm, regardless if it was planned, or due to flight delays. Please check your flights before booking, so you know what to expect. ","other_things_to_note":"Other things to note Who shouldn't book this apartment: We have put a lot of love, time, and dedication in creating such a beautiful space, therefore... If you're looking for a party place, this apartment is not your best option. College-aged get togethers involving alcohol generally bring spillages, burns, stains, breaks, tears in fabric, and  especially, lots of head aches when you realize the damages. Some owners will overlook them, please know that I won't! If you smoke, please refrain from booking this apartment. The smell of cigars, cigarettes, and marijuana, even if smoked outside with the balcony door closed, my experience is that the smell inevitably gets to the cushions and fabrics inside. If I need to send anything to the dry cleaners, unfortunately, I'll have to transfer that cost to you, plus an administrative fee of $25.","the_neighborhood":"","place_offers":{"Scenic views":["Bay view","Marina view","Sea view"],"Bathroom":["Hair dryer","Cleaning products","Shampoo","Conditioner","Body soap","Hot water"],"Bedroom and laundry":["Washer","Free dryer \u2013 In unit","Essentials","Hangers","Bed linens","Room-darkening shades","Iron"],"Entertainment":["HDTV with standard cable","Exercise equipment"],"Heating and cooling":["Central air conditioning"],"Home safety":["Smoke alarm","Carbon monoxide alarm"],"Internet and office":["Wifi","Dedicated workspace"],"Kitchen and dining":["Kitchen","Refrigerator","Microwave","Cooking basics","Dishes and silverware","Freezer","Dishwasher","Stainless steel electric stove","Oven","Hot water kettle","Coffee maker","Wine glasses","Toaster","Baking sheet","Blender","Dining table"],"Outdoor":["Private patio or balcony","Outdoor furniture","Outdoor dining area"],"Parking and facilities":["Free parking on premises","Shared outdoor pool - available all year, open specific hours"],"Services":["Host greets you"],"Not included":["Security cameras on property","Heating"]},"sub_rating":{"Cleanliness":"5.0","Accuracy":"4.8","Communication":"4.9","Location":"4.9","Check-in":"4.8","Value":"4.8"},"overallrating":"","overallcount":"","house_rules":{"Checking in and out":["Check-in: 4:00 PM - 10:00 PM","Checkout before 11:00 AM"],"During your stay":["3 guests maximum","No pets","No parties or events","No smoking"],"Before you leave":["Gather used towels","Throw trash away","Return keys","Additional requests"]},"safety_property":{"Safety devices":["Carbon monoxide alarm installed","Smoke alarm installed"]},"rooms_details":{"Living room":"1 air mattress","Bedroom":"1 king bed"}},{"image_uls":["https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/d224c899-0e69-406d-b4cb-d263a3f93206.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/575d59b6-70c7-43d7-ae21-554a30134309.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/dd201f69-311e-4e64-81d5-25e4109c70ef.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/963ec91c-fb8a-4368-bf66-c4d3d13a5c94.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/63af17f4-ab18-4216-aaac-60e67f222f37.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/8b5c6edf-47e1-40ea-acda-0756c1c4cfab.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/18db91f6-da08-45c5-8141-57a3787beeed.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/ed1b4f31-1351-4ef3-973a-760192ddbc99.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/58b97f3f-2ee6-443a-a997-62805c77b5d9.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/c7daa0a8-26b0-4e2c-9f6d-7f556a313328.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/44ea5ce6-fbf2-464b-8ab6-53cd58f1996f.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/f7c67808-2150-4cfa-a0f8-d220224e9323.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/f082d633-2ae6-425d-a116-d946e045cfd9.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/91135fa5-9607-45e7-b137-aae4a0c86ec0.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/14e8b5ed-7c74-4ead-9e76-864b242834bf.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/miso\/Hosting-53004896\/original\/1045b65a-de55-4541-8836-ad5f26c7b995.jpeg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/916cdd2e-aef7-44cc-ac3a-5a8c2fcd3163.jpg","https:\/\/a0.muscache.com\/pictures\/5909f5bd-377c-4ac0-b6d6-b0b1529f2439.jpg"],"summary":"A modern style and freshly renovated large beachfront studio apartment in Miami Beach with 180 degree ocean views of the crystal clear water and free parking.
